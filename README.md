# Ashera

Ashera is a read polishing tool inspired by [lbcb-sci/racon](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/racon) and borrows ideas from [hifiasm](https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm) for SNP detection. It is available as a stand alone tool and as a library.

### Status
Currently Ashera is in its alpha stage; not thoroughly tested and benchmarked but stable enough to produce decent results.
